NAME
        WorkspaceText.pm - Text editor widget.

SYNOPSIS
        use Tk::WorkspaceText;

        my $w = new Tk::WorkspaceText (<options>);

DESCRIPTION
    The Tk::WorkspaceText widget is derived from the Tk::Text and
    Tk::TextUndo widgets. For information about standard options, refer to
    the widgets' documentation.

    Tk::WorkspaceText widgets use fixed tabs, and support paragraph filling
    and selection, a "text modified" flag, recentering, and additional key
    bindings.

    Paragraphs are defined as contiguous lines of text separated by blank
    lines.

WIDGET METHODS
    The Tk::WorkspaceText widget supports the configure and cget methods
    described in the the Tk::options manpage documentation. The
    Tk::WorkspaceText widget also inherits all the methods of the the
    Tk::Widget manpage, the Tk::Text manpage, and the Tk::TextUndo manpage
    widget classes.

    In addition, Tk::WorkspaceText widgets recognize these methods:

    *$text*->paragraphFill
        Fill the paragraph that contains the insertion point. Paragraphs are
        defined as a series of contiguous lines of text separated by blank
        lines. Text is filled against the left margin, and wraps before the
        right margin, which can be set with the wrapcolumn method, below.

    *$text*->selectPara
        Select the entire paragraph. As with paragraphFill, paragraphs are
        defined as a set of contiguous lines separated by blank lines.

    *$text*->prevPara
        Set the insertion cursor to the first line of a paragraph. Does
        nothing if the insertion cursor is already on the first line of the
        paragraph.

    *$text*->setFixedTabs
        Set fixed tab stops to the value of the numeric argument. Tab stops
        occur every 8 columns by default.

    *$text*->center
        Center the line that contains the insertion cursor in the window.

    *$text*->modified
        With argument, sets the modified flag to the argument. With no
        argument, returns the value of the modified flag. By default, the
        value of the modified flag is '1' if text was modified, '' if
        unmodified.

    *$text*->setFillColumn
        Set the right margin column for filling paragraphs. The default is
        column 65.

KEY BINDINGS
    Tk::WorkspaceText widgets support the keybindings of the Tk::Text and
    Tk::TextUndo widgets, in addition to its own bindings. For further
    information, please refer to the the Tk::Text manpage, the Tk::TextUndo
    manpage and the Tk::bind manpage man pages.
